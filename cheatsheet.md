Global tools are installed in `$HOME/.dotnet/tools` on Linux and macOS. On Windows they are installed in the `%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet\tools` folder. Instead of the `--global` switch use the `--tool-path [folder]` to install the tool to a custom directory. If no `--global` or `--tool-path` is specified, then the tool is installed to the current C# project.

## Useful tools

* **dotnet-ef**

	The command-line interface (CLI) tools for Entity Framework Core perform design-time development tasks. For example, they create migrations, apply migrations, and generate code for a model based on an existing database. The commands are an extension to the cross-platform dotnet command, which is part of the .NET Core SDK. These tools work with .NET Core projects. 
    
    Install with: `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`

    More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet

* **csharprepl**

    A cross-platform command line REPL for the rapid experimentation and exploration of C#. It supports IntelliSense, installing NuGet packages, and referencing local .NET projects and assemblies. 
    
    Install with: `dotnet tool install -g csharprepl`

    More info: https://github.com/waf/CSharpRepl
	
* **IronPython**

	IronPython is an open-source implementation of the Python programming language that is tightly integrated with .NET. IronPython can use .NET and Python libraries, and other .NET languages can use Python code just as easily.
    
    Install with: `dotnet tool install -g IronPython.Console`

    More info: https://ironpython.net/

* **dotnet-format**

    Dotnet-format is a code formatter for dotnet that applies style preferences to a project or solution. Preferences will be read from an .editorconfig file, if present, otherwise a default set of preferences will be used.
    
    Install with: `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format`

    More info: https://github.com/dotnet/format

* **.NET Upgrade Assistant**
  
	The .NET Upgrade Assistant is a Visual Studio extension and command-line tool that's designed to assist with upgrading apps to the latest version of .NET.
    
    Install with: `dotnet tool install -g upgrade-assistant`

    More info: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant

* **SlnGen**

    SlnGen is a Visual Studio solution file generator. Visual Studio solutions generally do not scale well for large project trees. They are scoped views of a set of projects. Enterprise-level builds use custom logic like traversal to convey how they should be built by a hosted build environment. Maintaining Visual Studio solutions becomes hard because you have to keep them in sync with the other build logic. Instead, SlnGen reads the project references of a given project to create a Visual Studio solution on demand. For example, you can run it against a unit test project and be presented with a Visual Studio solution containing the unit test project and all of its project references.

    Install with: `dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.VisualStudio.SlnGen.Tool --add-source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --ignore-failed-sources`

    More info: https://github.com/microsoft/slngen

* **Roslynator Cli**

    Roslynator is a set of code analysis tools for C#, powered by Roslyn.

    Install with: `dotnet tool install -g roslynator.dotnet.cli`

    More info: https://josefpihrt.github.io/docs/roslynator/cli

Note: `nint` and `nuint` represent the platforms native integer type. For 32 bit systems this will be a 32 bit integer, so the limitations and properties of `int`
 or `uint` aplies. On 64 bit systems the limitations and properties of `long` and `ulong` applies.

# Important interfaces for types

## IComparable\<T\>

Defines a generalized comparison method that a value type or class implements to create a type-specific comparison method for ordering or sorting its instances.

```csharp
interface IComparable<T>
{
	int CompareTo (T? other);
}
```

The CompareTo returns a value that indicates the relative order of the objects being compared. The return value has these meanings:

| Value | Meaning |
| :--| :-- |
| Less than zero | This instance precedes other in the `sort` order. |
| Zero | This instance occurs in the same position in the `sort` order as other. |
| Greater than zero | This instance follows other in the sort order. |

## IComparer\<T\>

Defines a method that a type implements to compare two objects.

This interface is used with the `List<T>.Sort` and `List<T>.BinarySearch` methods. It provides a way to customize the sort order of a collection. Classes that implement this interface include the `SortedDictionary<TKey,TValue>` and `SortedList<TKey,TValue>` generic classes.

The default implementation of this interface is the `Comparer<T>` class. The `StringComparer` class implements this interface for type String.

```csharp
interface IComparer<T>
{
	int Compare (T? x, T? y);
}
```

Return a signed integer that indicates the relative values of x and y, as shown in the following table:

| Value | Meaning |
| :--| :-- |
| Less than zero |`x` is less than `y`. |
| Zero | `x` equals `y`. |
| Greater than zero | `x` is greater than `y`. |

## IEquatable\<T\>

Defines a generalized method that a value type or class implements to create a type-specific method for determining equality of instances.

```csharp
interface IEquatable<T>
{
	bool Equals (T? other);
}
```

Note: If a type implements the `IEquatable<T>`, then the type must override the `Equals(object? other)` and `GetHashCode()` methods provided also.

## EqualityComparer\<T\>

Defines methods to support the comparison of objects for equality. This interface allows the implementation of customized equality comparison for collections. That is, you can create your own definition of equality for type `T`, and specify that this definition be used with a collection type that accepts the `IEqualityComparer<T>` generic interface.

```csharp
interface IEqualityComparer<T>
{
	bool Equals (T? x, T? y);
	int GetHashCode (T obj);
}
```

## IDisposable & IAsyncDisposable

The `IDisposable` interface is used to release unmanaged resources like file handles, database connections, network connections, or any resource that is not managed by the .NET runtime.

The `IDisposable` interface is typically implemented when a class holds onto resources that need to be explicitly released or closed to avoid potential resource leaks and do a proper cleanup. By implementing `IDisposable`, you can provide a mechanism for users of your class to explicitly release those resources when they're done with them, rather than relying on the garbage collector to eventually clean them up.

The `IAsyncDisposable` interface is similar to `IDisposable`, but it is specifically designed for asynchronous resource cleanup scenarios.

If you implement the `IAsyncDisposable` interface but not the `IDisposable` interface, your app can potentially leak resources. If a class implements `IAsyncDisposable`, but not `IDisposable`, and a consumer only calls `Dispose()`, your implementation would never call `DisposeAsync()`. This would result in a resource leak.

Implementation example:

```csharp
public class AsyncDisposable : IAsyncDisposable, IDisposable
{
    //a flag to indicate whether the object has been disposed to prevent multiple dispose calls
    private bool _disposed;

    //A disposable field
    private readonly MemoryStream _field;

    public AsyncDisposable()
    {
        _field = new MemoryStream();
    }

    //IDosposable implementation. Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in the Dispose(bool disposing) method
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(disposing: true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    //IAsyncDisposable implementation. Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in the DisposeAsyncCore method
    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        //Call the overridable DisposeAsyncCore that does the actual work
        await DisposeAsyncCore().ConfigureAwait(false);

        //no need to call finalizer, because the resources have been freed by the DisposeAsyncCore method
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    // Async version of Dispose method
    protected virtual async ValueTask DisposeAsyncCore()
    {
        if (!_disposed)
        {
            await _field.DisposeAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
    }

    // Sync version of Dispose method
    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                //Dispose managed state (managed objects)
                _field.Dispose();
            }

            // TODO: free unmanaged resources (unmanaged objects) and override finalizer
            // TODO: set large fields to null
            _disposed = true;
        }
    }

    //TODO: override finalizer only if 'Dispose(bool disposing)' has code to free unmanaged resources
    // ~AsyncDisposable()
    // {
    //     // Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) method
    //     Dispose(disposing: false);
    // }
}
```

## Custom numeric format strings

| Format specifier |                     Name                     |                                                        Description                                                        |
| :--------------: | :------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|       `0`        |               Zero placeholder               |      Replaces the zero with the corresponding digit if one is present; otherwise, zero appears in the result string.      |
|       `#`        |              Digit placeholder               | Replaces the "#" symbol with the corresponding digit if one is present; otherwise, no digit appears in the result string. |
|       `.`        |                Decimal point                 |                          Determines the location of the decimal separator in the result string.                           |
|       `,`        | Group separator, number scaling <sup>I</sup> |                             Serves as both a group separator and a number scaling specifier.                              |
|       `%`        |            Percentage placeholder            |                Multiplies a number by 100 and inserts a localized percentage symbol in the result string.                 |
|       `â°`        |            Per mille placeholder             |                Multiplies a number by 1000 and inserts a localized per mille symbol in the result string.                 |
|       `E0`       |      Exponential notation <sup>II</sup>      |                   If followed by at least one 0 (zero), formats the result using exponential notation.                    |
|       `\`        |       Escape character <sup>III</sup>        |            Causes the next character to be interpreted as a literal rather than as a custom format specifier.             |
|       `;`        |       Section separator <sup>IV</sup>        |                  Defines sections with separate format strings for positive, negative, and zero numbers.                  |
|    any other     |             All other characters             |                                  The character is copied to the result string unchanged.                                  |


**I**: . As a group separator, it inserts a localized group separator character between each group. As a number scaling specifier, it divides a number
 by 1000 for each comma specified.

**II**: The case of "E" or "e" indicates the case of the exponent symbol in the result string. The number of zeros following the "E" or "e" character determines
 the minimum number of digits in the exponent. A plus sign (+) indicates that a sign character always precedes the exponent. 
 A minus sign (-) indicates that a sign character precedes only negative exponents.

**III**: The `#`, `0`, `.`, `,`, `%`, and `â°` symbols in a format string are interpreted as format specifiers rather than as literal characters. 
Depending on their position in a custom format string, the uppercase and lowercase "E" as well as the + and - symbols may also be interpreted as format specifiers.

**IV**: The semicolon (;) is a conditional format specifier that applies different formatting to a number depending on whether its value is positive, negative, or zero. 
To produce this behaviour, a custom format string can contain up to three sections separated by semicolons. These sections are:

* One section:
  The format string applies to all values.

* Two sections:
  The first section applies to positive values and zeros, and the second section applies to negative values.

  If the number to be formatted is negative, but becomes zero after rounding according to the format in the second section,
  the resulting zero is formatted according to the first section.

* Three sections:
  The first section applies to positive values, the second section applies to negative values, and the third section applies to zeros.

  The second section can be left empty (by having nothing between the semicolons), in which case the first section applies to all non-zero values.

  If the number to be formatted is non-zero, but becomes zero after rounding according to the format in the first or second section,
  the resulting zero is formatted according to the third section.

Dictionary<int, string> customerDictionary
     = Customers.ToDictionary(customer => customer.Id, customer => customer.Name);
```

# Pattern matching

## Discard pattern

The discard pattern can be used to match any expression, including `null`. It's represented by the `_` symbol.

```csharp
bool isFloatingPointNumber(string input)
{
    //the out value of the conversion is discarded
    return double.TryParse(input, out double _);
}
```

## var pattern

The `var` pattern can be used to match any expression, including `null`, and assign its result to a new local variable:

```csharp
bool isFloatingPointNumber(string input)
{
    return double.TryParse(input, out var _);
}
```

## Declaration and type patterns

```csharp
object greeting = "Hello, World!";
if (greeting is string message)
{
	//greeting is a string and casted to message variable
}
```

A declaration pattern with type T matches an expression when an expression result is non-null and any of the following conditions are true:

* The run-time type of an expression result is T.
* The run-time type of an expression result derives from type T, implements interface T, or another implicit reference conversion exists from it to T.

**Null checking:**

```csharp
if (input is not null)
{
    // ...
}
```

**Type checking in switch:**

```csharp
public abstract class Vehicle {}
public class Car : Vehicle {}
public class Truck : Vehicle {}

public static class TollCalculator
{
    public static decimal CalculateToll(this Vehicle vehicle) => vehicle switch
    {
        Car _ => 2.00m,
        Truck _ => 7.50m,
        null => throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(vehicle)),
        _ => throw new ArgumentException("Unknown type of a vehicle", nameof(vehicle)),
    };
}
```

## Constant pattern

```csharp
public static decimal GetGroupTicketPrice(int visitorCount) => visitorCount switch
{
    1 => 12.0m,
    2 => 20.0m,
    3 => 27.0m,
    0 => 0.0m,
    _ => throw new ArgumentException($"Not supported number of visitors: {visitorCount}", nameof(visitorCount)),
};
```

In a constant pattern, you can use any constant expression, such as integers, floating-point numbers, char, string, boolean, enums, name of a declared const field or local and null. Note: `Span<char>` or `ReadOnlySpan<char>` can also be matched in the constant pattern, but in C# 11 and later versions

## Relational patterns

```csharp
static string Classify(double measurement) => measurement switch
{
    < -4.0 => "Too low",
    > 10.0 => "Too high",
    double.NaN => "Unknown",
    _ => "Acceptable",
};
```

In a relational pattern, you can use any of the relational operators `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`. The right-hand part of a relational pattern must be a constant expression. For the constant expression, the constant pattern limitations apply.

## Logical patterns

```csharp
static string Classify(double measurement) => measurement switch
{
    < -40.0 => "Too low",
    >= -40.0 and < 0 => "Low",
    >= 0 and < 10.0 => "Acceptable",
    >= 10.0 and < 20.0 => "High",
    >= 20.0 => "Too high",
    double.NaN => "Unknown",
};
```

```csharp
static string GetCalendarSeason(DateTime date) => date.Month switch
{
    3 or 4 or 5 => "spring",
    6 or 7 or 8 => "summer",
    9 or 10 or 11 => "autumn",
    12 or 1 or 2 => "winter",
    _ => throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(date), $"Date with unexpected month: {date.Month}."),
};
```

Precedence: `not`, `and`, `or`. To explicitly specify the precedence, use parentheses:

```csharp
static bool IsLetter(char c) => c is (>= 'a' and <= 'z') or (>= 'A' and <= 'Z');
```

## Property Pattern

```csharp
static bool IsConferenceDay(DateTime date) => date is { Year: 2020, Month: 5, Day: 19 or 20 or 21 };
```

A property pattern matches an expression when an expression result is non-null and every nested pattern matches the corresponding property or field of the expression result. It can be combined with run-time type check and variable declaration:

```csharp
static string TakeFive(object input) => input switch
{
    string { Length: >= 5 } s => s.Substring(0, 5),
    string s => s,

    ICollection<char> { Count: >= 5 } symbols => new string(symbols.Take(5).ToArray()),
    ICollection<char> symbols => new string(symbols.ToArray()),

    null => throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input)),
    _ => throw new ArgumentException("Not supported input type."),
};
```

## Positional pattern

You use a positional pattern to deconstruct an expression result and match the resulting values against the corresponding nested patterns.

```csharp
public readonly struct Point
{
    public int X { get; }
    public int Y { get; }

    public Point(int x, int y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);
    public void Deconstruct(out int x, out int y) => (x, y) = (X, Y);
}

static string Classify(Point point) => point switch
{
    (0, 0) => "Origin",
    (1, 0) => "positive X basis end",
    (0, 1) => "positive Y basis end",
    _ => "Just a point",
};
```

At the preceding example, the type of an expression contains the Deconstruct method, which is used to deconstruct an expression result. You can also match expressions of tuple types against positional patterns. In that way, you can match multiple inputs against various patterns:

```csharp
static decimal GetGroupTicketPriceDiscount(int groupSize, DateTime visitDate)
    => (groupSize, visitDate.DayOfWeek) switch
    {
        (<= 0, _) => throw new ArgumentException("Group size must be positive."),
        (_, DayOfWeek.Saturday or DayOfWeek.Sunday) => 0.0m,
        (>= 5 and < 10, DayOfWeek.Monday) => 20.0m,
        (>= 10, DayOfWeek.Monday) => 30.0m,
        (>= 5 and < 10, _) => 12.0m,
        (>= 10, _) => 15.0m,
        _ => 0.0m,
    };
```

## List patterns

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3 };

numbers is [1, 2, 3]; //true
numbers is [1, 2, 4]; //false
numbers is [1, 2, 3, 4]; //false
numbers is [0 or 1, <= 2, >= 3]; //true
```

To match elements only at the start or/and the end of an input sequence, use the slice pattern (`..`);  A slice pattern matches zero or more elements. You can use at most one slice pattern in a list pattern. The slice pattern can only appear in a list pattern.

```csharp
new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } is [> 0, > 0, ..];  // True
new[] { 1, 1 } is [_, _, ..];  // True
new[] { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 } is [> 0, > 0, ..];  // False
new[] { 1 } is [1, 2, ..];  // False

new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 } is [.., > 0, > 0];  // True
new[] { 2, 4 } is [.., > 0, 2, 4];  // False
new[] { 2, 4 } is [.., 2, 4];  // True

new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 } is [>= 0, .., 2 or 4];  // True
new[] { 1, 0, 0, 1 } is [1, 0, .., 0, 1];  // True
new[] { 1, 0, 1 } is [1, 0, .., 0, 1];  // False
```

**Symmetric encryption**

Symmetric encryption is a cryptographic method where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data. In other words, the sender and the recipient use a shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is commonly used in various applications, including securing data transmission over networks, encrypting files stored on disk, and protecting sensitive information in databases. 

**Asymmetric encryption**

Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, is a cryptographic method that uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. A public, and a private key. The pair of keys are mathematically related, but distinct. It is widely used in various applications, including secure Communication, digital signatures and key exchange.

## Hash Algorithms

![Cryptography](img/cryptography2.svg)

**Hash Algorithms**

A hash algorithm, also known as a cryptographic hash function, is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (or "message") and produces a fixed-size string of bytes, which are typically represented as a hexadecimal number or it is base64 encoded.

Hash algorithms have several important properties: They are deterministic. For a given input, the hash algorithm always produces the same output and given a hash value, it should be computationally infeasible to determine the original input.

A cryptographic hash function is resilient to collision. It should be extremely unlikely for two different inputs to produce the same hash value. This property is crucial for ensuring the integrity of data. Even a small change in the input should result in a significantly different hash value.

Hash algorithms are widely used in cryptography for various purposes, including data integrity checks, digital signatures and password storage.

It's worth noting that while MD5 and SHA-1 were once widely used, they are now considered vulnerable to various attacks, and it's generally recommended to use stronger hash functions such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 for cryptographic purposes.

**HMAC**

Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAG), is a mechanism for generating a cryptographic hash of data in combination with a secret key. It provides a way to verify both the integrity and authenticity of a message.

HMAC takes two inputs - the message to be authenticated and a secret key known only to the sender and the receiver. It uses a cryptographic hash function (such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) to process the message. The secret key is mixed with the message in a specific way, usually by XOR operations and padding, to create a unique digest. The mixed data is then hashed using the chosen hash function and the output of the hash function is the HMAC.

The recipient, who knows the secret key, can generate the HMAC using the received message and compare it to the transmitted HMAC. If they match, it indicates that the message has not been tampered with during transmission and that it was sent by someone with knowledge of the secret key.

# UI

* **Windows Forms**

    Windows Forms is a UI framework for building Windows desktop apps. It provides one of the most productive ways to create desktop apps based on the visual designer provided in Visual Studio. Functionality such as drag-and-drop placement of visual controls makes it easy to build desktop apps.

* **WPF**

    Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a UI framework that is resolution-independent and uses a vector-based rendering engine, built to take advantage of modern graphics hardware. WPF provides a comprehensive set of application-development features that include Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), controls, data binding, layout, 2D and 3D graphics, animation, styles, templates, documents, media, text, and typography. WPF is part of .NET, so you can build applications that incorporate other elements of the .NET API.

## MVVM

The MVVM pattern helps cleanly separate an application's business and presentation logic from its user interface (UI). Maintaining a clean separation between application logic and the UI helps address numerous development issues and makes an application easier to test, maintain, and evolve. It can also significantly improve code re-use opportunities and allows developers and UI designers to collaborate more easily when developing their respective parts of an app.

    Represents a control with a single piece of content of any type. The ContentControl can contain any type of common language runtime object (such as a string or a DateTime object) or a UIElement object (such as a Rectangle or a Panel).

* **ItemsControl**

    Represents a control that can be used to present a collection of items. An ItemsControl is a type of Control that can contain multiple items, such as strings, objects, or other elements.

* **Selector**

    Represents a control that allows a user to select items from among its child elements.

* **RangeBase**

    Represents an element that has a value within a specific range.

![MarshalByRefObject derivatives](img/winforms01.svg)

* **MarshalByRefObject**

    Enables access to objects across application domain boundaries in applications that support remoting.

* **Component**

    Provides the base implementation for the IComponent interface and enables object sharing between applications. Component is the base class for all components in the common language runtime that marshal by reference. Component is remotable and derives from the MarshalByRefObject class. Component provides an implementation of the IComponent interface. The MarshalByValueComponent provides an implementation of IComponent that marshals by value.


* **NativeWindow**

    Provides a low-level encapsulation of a window handle and a window procedure. This class automatically manages window class creation and registration. A window is not eligible for garbage collection when it is associated with a window handle. To ensure proper garbage collection, handles must either be destroyed manually using DestroyHandle or released using ReleaseHandle.

* **BindableComponent**

    Base class for components that provide properties that can be data bound with the Windows Forms Designer.

* **ToolStripItem**

    Represents the abstract base class that manages events and layout for all the elements that a ToolStrip or ToolStripDropDown can contain.

* **CommonDialog**

    Specifies the base class used for displaying dialog boxes on the screen. Inherited classes are required to implement RunDialog by invoking ShowDialog to create a specific common dialog box. Inherited classes can optionally override HookProc to implement specific dialog box hook functionality.

* **Control**

    Defines the base class for controls, which are components with visual representation. The Control class implements very basic functionality required by classes that display information to the user. It handles user input through the keyboard and pointing devices. It handles message routing and security. It defines the bounds of a control (its position and size), although it does not implement painting. It provides a window handle (hWnd).

* **AxHost**

    Wraps ActiveX controls and exposes them as fully featured Windows Forms controls.

* **MdiClient**

    Represents the container for multiple-document interface (MDI) child forms. This class cannot be inherited.

* **ElementHost**

    A Windows Forms control that can be used to host a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) element.

* **ScrollableControl**

    Defines a base class for controls that support auto-scrolling behavior. To enable a control to display scroll bars as needed, set the AutoScroll property to true and set the AutoScrollMinSize property to the desired size. When the control is sized smaller than the specified minimum size, or a child control is located outside the bounds of the control, the appropriate scroll bars are displayed.


* **ContainerControl**

    Provides focus-management functionality for controls that can function as a container for other controls. The container control can capture the TAB key press and move focus to the next control in the collection.

* **Panel**

    Used to group collections of controls. You can use a Panel to group collections of controls such as a group of RadioButton controls. As with other container controls such as the GroupBox control, if the Panel control's Enabled property is set to false, the controls contained within the Panel will also be disabled.

* **ThreadExceptionDialog**

    Implements a dialog box that is displayed when an unhandled exception occurs in a thread. **This API supports the product infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from your code.**

* **UserControl**

    The UserControl gives you the ability to create controls that can be used in multiple places within an application or organization. You can include all the code needed for validation of common data you ask the user to input.
